ðŸ“Œ Description:
In this lab, I deployed and configured Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM & SOAR solution, to detect and investigate security threats in a Windows environment. The lab involved deploying Sentinel, configuring data connectors, setting up analytics rules, simulating security events, and investigating incidents using threat intelligence tools.

ðŸ“Œ Key Responsibilities & Tasks:

âœ… Deploying Microsoft Sentinel & Configuring Data Sources

Deployed Microsoft Sentinel in Azure and linked it to Log Analytics

Installed the Windows Security Events solution and configured data connectors

âœ… Threat Detection â€“ Configuring Analytics Rules

Used rule templates to detect security threats like:
ðŸ”¹ Hidden Scheduled Tasks (persistence techniques)
ðŸ”¹ Excessive Windows Logon Failures (brute-force attempts)

Adjusted query scheduling for real-time alerting & incident grouping

âœ… Security Monitoring â€“ Configuring Auditing Policies

Enabled Object Access Auditing to track unauthorized access attempts

Configured Registry Auditing to detect changes in scheduled tasks

âœ… Simulating Cybersecurity Threats

Executed a brute-force attack simulation using a scheduled task

Hid the task via registry modifications to evade detection

Verified password exposure, demonstrating a successful attack simulation

âœ… Incident Investigation & Response

Used Microsoft Sentinelâ€™s Incidents feature to review alerts

Investigated event logs, user behavior, and anomalies

Leveraged Threat Intelligence & Investigation Graphs to analyze attack paths

ðŸ“Œ Skills Gained:
ðŸ”¹ SIEM Deployment & Threat Detection | ðŸ”¹ KQL for Log Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Incident Response & SOAR Automation | ðŸ”¹ Security Event Auditing

ðŸ“Œ Outcome:
This project strengthened my security monitoring, investigation, and incident response skills using Microsoft Sentinel in a real-world security scenario.
